Hi there !

My ML teammate and I are working on an academic machine learning project focused on the Navrood River. The dataset includes river discharge measurements before and after rainfall, the amount of rainfall, and the date of each measurement. The primary goal of this project is to identify the best machine learning model and train it on the dataset to predict the river's discharge."
